## ‚ö†Ô∏è Significant Gaps & Missing Features

### 1. User Profiles & Personalization ‚ùå **CRITICAL GAP**
**PRD Requirement:** User profiles with dietary preferences, skill level, favorites  
**Current State:** No user authentication or profile system  
**Impact:** High - Core MVP feature missing

### 2. Offline Storage üü° **PARTIALLY ADDRESSED**
**PRD Requirement:** Recipes stored locally for offline cooking  
**Current State:** LocalStorage implementation for recipe persistence, but no PWA/Service Worker offline functionality  
**Impact:** Medium - Core storage implemented, need PWA for full offline experience

### 3. Recipe Customization ‚úÖ **ADDRESSED**
**PRD Requirement:** Multiple skill versions, device-based cooking methods  
**Current State:** Enhanced recipe system supports multiple instruction levels (beginner/intermediate/advanced) and equipment variations  
**Impact:** ‚úÖ Fully implemented in enhanced recipe system

### 4. Mobile Optimization ‚ùå **MAJOR GAP**
**PRD Requirement:** iOS & Android (React Native recommended)  
**Current State:** Web-based React app, not mobile app  
**Impact:** High - Platform mismatch with target audience

### 5. Content Volume ‚ùå **MODERATE GAP**
**PRD Requirement:** 50-75 curated recipes at launch  
**Current State:** 6 sample recipes  
**Impact:** Medium - Need significant content expansion

### 6. Equipment-Based Filtering ‚úÖ **ADDRESSED**
**PRD Requirement:** Filter by equipment type (oven, stovetop, air fryer, microwave)  
**Current State:** Full equipment-based filtering implemented in enhanced recipe system  
**Impact:** ‚úÖ Fully implemented with support for multiple equipment variations per recipe

## üîß Technical Debt & Architecture Issues

### 1. Platform Mismatch
- **Issue:** Built as web app, PRD specifies mobile app
- **Impact:** Major architectural decision needed
- **Recommendation:** Decide on React Native migration or PWA approach

### 2. Data Persistence ‚úÖ **ADDRESSED**
- **Previous Issue:** All data was static, no backend or local storage
- **Current State:** Full localStorage implementation with enhanced recipe management
- **Impact:** ‚úÖ Recipes now persist locally with full CRUD operations
- **Remaining:** Need user profiles and PWA for complete offline experience

### 3. State Management
- **Issue:** Basic useState for complex filtering logic
- **Impact:** May become unwieldy as features grow
- **Recommendation:** Consider Context API or state management library

## üìà Progress Toward Success Metrics

### PRD Success Metrics Analysis:
- **10,000 downloads in 6 months:** ‚ùå Cannot achieve - not a mobile app yet
- **3+ recipes viewed per session:** ‚úÖ Good foundation with recipe modal and search
